# BASIC ETIQUETTE FOR OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTION

1. *Why contribute*? Ask yourself why you are contributing to the project. Having a clear reason as to why you are working on the project will help you choose what to work on faster. Even if you do not have a clear intention it is still ok as long as you are not hindering the project and its contributors.

2. *Be kind*. It is important for contributors to work as a team and have a positive environment in the team. This is best possible by thanking, congratulating, being respectful and 
pointing out mistakes in a non judgemental manner. Try to stay on topic while writing messages and stay off controversial topics.

3. *Be useful*. When you contribute to a project ask yourself whether your contribution will genuinely improve the project or not. Try to make it as easy as possible for the mentors to review your fixes and contributions. For example, try not to cram multiple fixes into a single pull request as it gets confusing and raises suspicion.

4. *Be patient*. Keep in mind that all the contributors work for free and have busy lives. Sometimes your pull request may take time to get reviewed. In these cases be patient and after a couple of days message them politely.If someone is waiting on you to do something try to do it at the earliest.

5. *Be informed*. It is important to read the manual of a project before contributing to it. Also find out where the best place is to ask questions. Most importantly, dont be afraid to ask questions but always make an effort to find the answer on the web before asking your mentor.
