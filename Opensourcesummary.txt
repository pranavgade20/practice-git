Contributing to open-source projects can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, share, and build experience. People get to know each other who are contributing in the same field as they are and share their ideas among themselves. There are some do’s and dont’s in the open-source community. One should respect, be modest, and patiently wait for others’ work and not troll/boss around and show off. Aside from that, no assumptions should be made about a person’s expertise, gender, sexuality, or experience. Always adhere to the standards outlined in the Code of Conduct and make meaningful contributions to the project. Finally, keep in mind that even if someone does not react to your questions, be patient and don’t make a fuss because they are doing this for free and, in the end, it will be you who will profit from their advice.s
